# Core
* Added a new interface `\Shopwell\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionalAction` which flow actions can implement to flag that they should be executed within a database transaction.
* Added `\Shopwell\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionFailedException` so that transactional actions can force a rollback. 
* Changed `\Shopwell\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\FlowDispatcher` to rethrow exceptions which occur during a nested transaction if save points are not enabled.

See [ADR](../../adr/2024-02-11-transactional-flow-actions.md) for more info.
