### Today dashboard statistics

The Administration homepage now shows today's product sales, successful refunds, wallet top-ups, membership activations, and hourly sales in the operator's timezone.
`GET /api/_admin/dashboard/today` provides these statistics in the system currency, with comparisons to the same local time yesterday for all four metric cards.
The endpoint derives its timezone from the authenticated user profile.
Product sales exclude wallet top-ups and membership purchases, and duplicate successful payment attempts do not create additional sales.
Posted wallet top-ups are reported separately with amount and count, subject to wallet transaction read permission.
Membership activations count distinct customers by successful activation time, including renewals, subject to membership purchase read permission.
Wallet amounts use current exchange factors and are accumulated in system currency minor units.
The former order-amount endpoint has been replaced by the today endpoint.
